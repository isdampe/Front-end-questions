/*
 * SCSS Question 3.
 * While working on a client site, they have style guide with specific colors that
 * require re-use throughout the stylesheet.
 * It's easier to update a color once, rather than in each instance the color is used.
 * Create variables and assign them where necessary below.
 * A developer should then be able to replace each colour once without performing a find and replace function.
 * $red: #ff1111;
 * $green: #008000;
